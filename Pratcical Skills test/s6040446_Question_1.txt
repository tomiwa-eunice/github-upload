Question 1a
Quality of the digital address book script
- the dictionary method created is efficient enough to create a good address book
- the phone numbers are stored using strings which is very good.
using a list for the values in the dictionary is very good since a list is mutable and
this allows the address book to be updated later on.


Question 1b
Additional script for updating the address book
addressbook = {}
kate = ["0506717171", "Hengelosestraat99"]
clara = ["Langestraat 25", "clara@itc.nl"]
amy = ["0347252525", "amy@itc.nl"]
addressbook["Kate"] = kate
addressbook["Clara"] = clara
addressbook["Amy"] = amy
addressbook["Kate"] = ["0506717171", "Hengelosestraat99", "kate@itc.nl"]
addressbook["Clara"] = ["Langestraat 25", "clara@itc.nl", "0628363636"]
addressbook["Amy"] = ["0347252525", "amy@itc.nl", "Walstraat 90"]
